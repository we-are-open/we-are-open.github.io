⚡️ We are a growing network of developers, scholars and proponents of Open Hardware, who foster exchange, create visibility, share knowledge, and improve the framework conditions for developing and distributing Open Hardware products in Europe.

⚡️ Our long-term goal is creating an ecosystem to provide consumers with Open Hardware choices in all product areas. We strive for a world where not only the consumer's right-to-repair is ubiquitous, but where one also has multiple choices to buy products that provide construction plans and production files openly.

⚡️ In order to reach this goal, we bundle economic, scientific and civil society backgrounds, and develop as well as promote strategies for Open Hardware. We think that Open Hardware is a necessary part of all new economical models for a sustainable, circular and post-growth society.
